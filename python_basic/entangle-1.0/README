       Entangle: Tethered Camera Control & Capture
       ===========================================

Entangle is an application which uses GTK and libgphoto2 to provide a
graphical interface for tethered photography with digital cameras.

It includes control over camera shooting and configuration settings
and 'hands off' shooting directly from the controlling computer.

Installation
------------

The Entangle package uses the Meson build system available from:

  http://mesonbuild.com/

As a quick start you can do

  meson build-dir
  ninja -C build-dir all
  sudo ninja -C build-dir install

Or to install into a private user specific location

  meson build-dir --prefix=$HOME/entangle
  ninja -C build-dir all
  ninja -C build-dir install

NB, if not installing in /usr, you need to set the XDG_DATA_DIRS env
variable to point to the data directory, eg in the above example use:

  XDG_DATA_DIRS=/usr/share:/usr/local/share:$HOME/entangle/share
  export XDG_DATA_DIRS

OS distro packagers should use the --disable-schemas-compile arg
to configure to skip the compilation stage for schema files if
installing to the /usr prefix
