	    Remove HAL support & make peas/introspection compulsory

2017-05-17  Matteo F. Vescovi  <mfvescovi+gitlab@gmail.com>

	Extend GNOME icon check to Adwaita theme
	The Adwaita icon theme now includes symbolic icons, so there is
	no need to use the GNOME symbolic icon theme. Leave the check
	present for people not using Adwaita though.

2016-07-12  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove signal handler callbacks from class structs
	The signal handler callbacks in class structs serve
	no useful purpose, so delete them.

	Remove prototypes for non-existant methods

2016-07-11  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Ensure session browser scrolls to right fully
	When scrolling to the right we must not only add the item size,
	but also twice the margin, to ensure we scroll over the full
	extent of the adjustment.

	Ensure highlight always has at least 1 pixel visible
	When highlighting square format images the highlight won't
	be visible ensure we allow a 1 pixel border.

2016-07-03  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add support for loading videos in session
	When scanning files to add to session use the mime type to pick
	files, instead of the file extension. Allow image/* and video/*
	as valid files

	Introduce EntangleVideo class
	Introduce a new media subclass for representing video files.
	It can be backed by a video file, or a dynamically created
	source using GStreamer.

	Draw symbolic icons for video/image files in session browser
	Prior to the real pixbuf being available, draw symbolic icons
	in the session browser to represent video/image files.

	Don't try to get status if no media is present.

	Generalize camera manager to deal with media files
	Remove assumption that current media is always an image
	from the camera manager. It now deals with any media
	file types.

	Generalize session browser to deal with media files
	Generalize the session browser API so that it works in terms
	of EntangleMedia objects instead of EntangleImage. Non-image
	objects are just rendered blank.

	Rename EntangleImagePopup to EntangleMediaPopup
	The image popup class can trivially support any type of media
	so rename it to EntangleMediaPopup.

	Rename EntangleImageStatusbar to EntangleMediaStatusbar
	Metadata is associated with the EntangleMedia base class,
	so the image statusbar can trivially be renamed to cope
	with any type of media.

	Generalize EntangleSession to deal with media files

	Generalize EntangleImage class to create EntangleMedia
	Prepare for support of videos by creating a base class
	for media files.

	Remove auto drawer class in favour of Gtk built-in widgets
	GTK 3.10 includes the GtkOverlay and GtkRevealer widgets
	which obsolete the need for the custom auto-drawer / overlay
	widgets.

	Use GdkSeat APIs for getting pointer where available

	Remove invalid transfer mode annotation

	Remove bogus return value annotation from camera class

2016-02-21  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix typo in release NEWS

	Add dep on libpeas-loader-python3

	Updates to 0.7.1 release

	Refresh translations from Zanata

2016-02-10  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Draw symbolic icons for video/image files in session browser
	Prior to the real pixbuf being available, draw symbolic icons
	in the session browser to represent video/image files.

	Handle setting of NULL image in image display
	The set_image_list method correctly handled NULLs, but the set_image
	method would get things wrong trying to set an image list containing
	a single element instead of zero elements.

	Refresh image statusbar labels immediately
	Don't wait for the 'metadata' property to be notified when setting
	the media for the statusbar - if the metadata is already loaded,
	this signal will never arrive. So always set the labels immediately

	Fix bounds check in session browser key press
	When processing right key press check boundary condition
	so we don't move selection past the last item

2016-01-04  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix deselecting current image when it is deleted
	Process the 'image removed' signal even when it reports NULL
	for the selected image, since we must de-select the current
	image if the last image is deleted.

	Rewrite session browser to dynamically size
	Remove all remaining traces of cell layout infrastructure
	and directly render images from the session data model.
	Dynamically scale the images to fill the available height
	using cairo for scaling at time of render.

	Switch to generating 256 pixel large thumbnails
	128 pixel "normal" thumbnails are just too small with modern
	hidpi displays

	Keep images in session sorted by last modified

	Make nikon fine focus step size smaller
	At a value of 4 a D90 often reports

	  "Nikon manual focus stepping too small"

	So pick 8 as fine step size.

	Trivial indent fix

	Flush events after capturing
	If we don't flush events after capturing, then when in preview
	mode we never process outstanding events. This leads to old
	camera events arriving when we stop preview mode, which can
	mistakenly cause gphoto to start preview again !

	Fix error reporting when saving camera controls

	Get rid of ENTANGLE_ERROR macro

	Render image status overlay partially transparent

	Remove style override from overlay box

	Remove gtk_adjustment_changed calls
	The gtk_adjustment_changed() method is called automatically by
	GTK when neccessary, so don't call it manually.

	Remove style context override in session browser
	With the dark theme, the default style matches what we need so
	don't override the style context. This avoids hitting deprecated
	GTK functions.

	Remove unused 'wait' function from shooter plugin

	Specify versions when importing libs

	Switch to use gdk_cursor_new_for_display
	gdk_cursor_new_for_display() is preferred over gdk_cursor_new()
	which is now deprecated

	convert to use GTask instead of GSimpleAsyncResult
	GSimpleAsyncResult has been deprecated in recent GIO, so
	switch over to use GTask internally.

2015-05-10  Pascal Mons  <pascal_mons@hotmail.com>

	Misc fixes to the help docs
	Fix spelling errors and use capitalization of all
	nouns/verbs in titles.

2015-03-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add itstool and gtk-doc to RPM deps

	Remove unused variable

2015-03-13  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Update repo url to gitlab.com

2015-03-12  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add further help manual pages

	Remove left over reference to progress bar

	Replace progress bar with a spinner
	The progress bar in latest GTK does not render in a way
	that is attractive in the toolbar. In addition file downloads
	are fast enough that detailed progress info is not really
	needed. It is sufficient to just use a spinner button to
	show the user that an operation is taking place.

2015-03-11  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Introduce plugin for repeated shooting sequences
	Add a 'shooter' plugin which allows shooting to be repeated
	in a sequence with an optional gap between shots.

	Add workaround for gphoto camera busy problems
	After downloading and/or deleting files, it is often not
	possible to capture / preview an image right away, as the
	camera reports busy. Add a 100ms sleep to give it time to
	come back to life. This should really be fixed in gphoto
	and reverted here later.

	Add a simplified script class to help non-C plugins
	The gobject introspection based languages have problems
	with propagating GErrors to & from the C layer, as well
	as dealing with the async ready callbacks. Introduce a
	simplified script class that avoids these problems.
	This relies on GTask introduced in glib 2.36

	Add framework for scripting capture operations
	Add a new EntangleScript class to be used for scripting the
	capture of images on the camera. The EntangleScriptConfig
	class provides user interface for configuring scripts.

	Switch to using a shared library instead of static
	When linking to static convenience libraries, the linker will
	drop any .o files which are not referenced in the final
	executable. This is despite the fact their symbols may be
	exported for using by dynamically loaded plugins. Switch to
	using a shared library so all code is guaranteed to be kept
	available.

	Remove duplicated compiler flags when linking

2015-03-08  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Introduce a yelp application manual

	Update copyright dates

	Set default window icon for application

2015-03-06  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Bug #22528

2015-02-05  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Updates for 0.6.1 release

	Refresh translations from transifex

	Add keywords to desktop & appdata files

	Revert "Fix capture during live view"
	This reverts commit 7af569be4ff35c4ca340c58878ee88a48beca910.

	Revert to old behaviour, because disabling live view before capture
	breaks ability to use manual focus :-(

2014-11-27  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix photobox plugin for recent widget name changes

	Fix capture during live view
	When the capture target is set to "memory card" an "PTP busy" error
	will be received when trying to capture an image while live view is
	active. Workaround this by explicitly disabling live view when
	capturing an image, instead of letting gphoto do this for us.

	Workaround gphoto bug detecting changed value for viewfinder.

	Avoid memory leak when waiting for camera events

2014-11-07  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Prevent over exposure of raw files
	Disable libraw auto brightness feature which totally overexposes
	dark images like deep sky shots.

2014-10-23  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix ordering of restoring controls to honour preferences

	Make the control panel editable
	Add a button with a popup menu to allow the list of controls
	to be changed.

	Rip out layout cruft from session browser that confused GTK
	The session browser re-layout code was causing problems with
	rendering in GTK resulting in major UI problem. Rip it all
	out since it didn't appear to have any beneficial purpose.

	Allow camera picker to show more than one line at a time.

	Remove use of GtkMisc APIs

	Remove code to disable double buffering
	GTK3 basically needs to have double buffering turned on all the
	time, so don't disable it.

	Convert float to double
	Floats are promoted to doubles when passed to var-args, so remove
	the explicit casts to float in favour of double.

	Rewrite condition to avoid gcc signed overflow warnings

	Import new manywarnings.m4 module from gnulib

	Skip -Wbad-function-cast warning
	GLib triggers warning

	warn.c: In function ‘foo’:
	warn.c:7:385: warning: cast from function call of type ‘long unsigned int’ to non-matching type ‘void *’ [-Wbad-function-cast]
	 if (g_once_init_enter (&initialization_value))

	but this cast is entirely expected and harmless so we should not
	warning on this.

	Fix some syntax check errors with tabs and for loops

2014-10-05  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Introduce per-camera model preferences to record control UI
	To prepare for customizable control panels, introduce a camera
	preferences object that will be created once per model name.

	Rewrite control panel to not suck so much
	Instead of adding all camera controls by default, only add a
	small useful set (aperture, shutter, iso, white balance, quality
	and image size).

	Require GTK 3.4

2014-10-04  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Strip trailing '2' from widget labels
	Some settings have multiple widgets and gphoto adds a trailing '2'
	so strip this off.

	Make entangle_control_group_get_by_path recursive
	Ensure that entangle_control_group_get_by_path can find child
	widgets to arbitrary depth by making it recursive

	Set a more sensible min height for histogram

	Move preferences object into the frontend
	The preferences are inherantly related to the user interface so
	should be part of the frontend codebase.

	Avoid adding the same plugin to preferences multiple times

2014-10-01  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Refactor camera operation out into a new automata object
	To facilitate its use in scripts, pull the code for controlling
	camera capture/preview out into a separate automata object.

2014-09-30  Jehan  <jehan@girinstud.io>

	Support of freedesktop's Thumbnail Management Standard.

	Add electronic shutter sub-option to continuous preview mode.

2014-09-29  Jehan  <jehan@girinstud.io>

	Minor configure bug on gio dependency check.

2014-09-21  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add missing capture icons to Makefile.am

2014-09-19  Jehan  <jehan@girinstud.io>

	Fix support for VPATH builds

2014-05-02  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Refresh translations from transifex

	Update to comply with latest appdata specs
	See

	http://blogs.gnome.org/hughsie/2014/05/02/appdata-meet-spdx-spdx-meet-appdata/

2014-05-01  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	The plugin schemas can be shipped pre-compiled in the RPM
	Since the plugin schemas are in a private directory they
	are ok to ship pre-compiled

	Add a BR in RPM for the symbolic icon theme

	Fix typos in docs

	Adjust pkg-config check for symbolic icon theme
	Older versions of the GNOME symbolic icon theme don't include
	a pkg-config file, so make the configure check fall back to
	looking for a specific file

	Disable progress display in preview mode
	The PTP driver for Canon EOS activates the progress meter when
	downloading preview images. This causes the display to flicker
	madly during preview.

	Try to ignore progress updates when preview mode is active, but
	still display when downloading the final captured image

	Fixes bug #21246

	Finish off the rest of the API docs

	Ignore more non-version controlled files

	Temporarily disable syncing camera clock
	Due to unresolved problems relating to timezone handling,
	disable the feature for syncing the camera clock from the
	computer.

	Related bug #20430

2014-04-23  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Make manual focus work with Canon cameras
	Canon cameras don't have an arbitrary delta for manual focus,
	just 3 discrete step sizes. Change the internal API to use
	discrete step sizes for both Canon and Nikon to give a consistent
	approach.

	Include port/model in debug when adding cameras

	Fix bug opening extra window at startup

	Use install-data-hook instead of install-data-local
	The schema must only be compiled after it is installed, so
	we must use install-data-hook which runs after install-data-am

	Fix install of schemas for plugin

	Port over to use lcms2 instead of lcms
	Support for lcms 1.x is dropped entirely since lcms2 has
	been around for long enough now - as long as GTK3 which
	we also require.

2014-04-14  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove duplicated plugin files in RPM spec

	Move icons into standard directory location
	For GNOME software center, the icon listed in desktop file must
	be in a standard directory location

	  https://github.com/hughsie/createrepo_as/blob/master/README.md#guidelines-for-applications

	Move all the icons into the standard "hicolor" icon theme so we
	can remove custom code for loading them too.

	Fixes bug #21904

	Fix incorrect whitespace around brackets

	Remove capture/preview icons no longer required
	Since switching to the symbolic icon theme, the custom
	capture/preview icons are no longer needed.

2014-04-11  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	Use the GNOME symbolic icon theme
	The symbolic icons look better in combination with the
	dark style theme.

	Use a dark theme
	The dark theme is for media applications, such as photo and video
	apps. We're one of those.

2014-04-11  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add API docs for pixbuf classes

	Add explicit method for setting capture target

2014-04-07  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Set automake subdir-objects declaration
	Make newer automake shut up about subdir-objects

	Remove auto-generation of gitignore files
	The git ignore file generator is not entirely reliable
	so not worth the trouble of using it.

	Fix name of menubar widget
	Then menubar was just renamed to 'win-menubar' and the code
	was not updated.

	Blank out source ID after removing it
	Avoid removing the same source twice in the auto drawer by
	blanking out the source ID.

	Update to deal with changed GExiv2 GIR version
	GExiv2 0.10 changed the GIR version from 0.4 to 0.10

	Fix override of GtkApplication startup method
	When overriding the startup method the parent impl must be
	the first thing invoked.

2014-04-05  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Don't auto connect to cameras without capture capability
	Only auto connect to cameras with the capture capability so
	that we don't connect to simple drivers doing only MTP / disk
	filesystem access.

	Create a sample plugin for setting up a photobox captive UI

	Remove use of deprecated libpeas APIs

	Add local source dir to plugin search path

	Change to use python3 for plugin language
	Change the peas plugin loader to use python for the language
	instead of gjs. This is to open up possibility to use the
	general python library ecosystem which is broader than the
	gjs compatible javascript ecosystem. Python3 is chosen instead
	of Python2 so we can avoid introducing a problem of having to
	switch python versions later.

	Add entangle_window_get_builder method
	Add an accessor for getting the GtkBuilder instance associated
	with a window, to allow plugins to get access to widgets in a
	fast manner.

	Add names for more widgets in camera manager
	To make life easier for plugin authors, give names to the key
	layout widgets i nthe camera manager.

	Set parent on camera error dialog
	Ensure that the camera error dialog is associated with the main
	manager window by setting its parent.

	Filter list of supported cameras to only those supporting capture/preview
	Instead of reporting all cameras known to gphoto2, only report those
	that support capture or preview capabilities. This removes all those
	which only support download, since there's not much of interest you
	can do with those in the application.

	Remove camera manual/about/driver help windows
	The camera manual/about/driver information reported by libgphoto2
	isn't really in any kind of user friendly format. It mostly has
	info that's developer targetted. Remove the UI for showing this
	information to simplify the UI.

2014-04-03  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Don't let preferences popup hold reference to the application
	When closing the main manager window, delete the prefs widget
	so it then allows the application to close.

	Revert "Don't let preferences popup hold reference to the application"
	This reverts commit 5f98d9694827d35c2d85f0b01329c56c3d1fd8dd.

2014-04-02  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix incorrect object type test in camera info popup

	Don't let preferences popup hold reference to the application
	If we register the preferences popup window with GtkApplication
	then the main loop will never exit, since we don't ever destroy
	the prefs window, merely hide / show it.

	Fix whitespace in for() statement

2014-04-02  Jesper Pedersen  <jesper.pedersen@comcast.net>

	Add customizable image background/highlight
	The use-case is that you want an "opposite" background color against
	what you are shooting, e.g. white background when shooting using a
	black backdrop.

2014-04-02  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Update copyright date in about dialog

2014-03-28  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Workaround for Nikon D5100 camera serial number
	At least one D5100 has been seen to append 25 zero characters
	to the serial number, so strip them off.

	Avoid circular updating of controls
	When loading config from the camera be careful not to trigger
	a change in the UI which in turn triggers a save to the
	camera again. Do this by comparing old / new values in the
	controls. Also avoiding calling save if no controls have been
	marked dirty. Finally also refresh the list of combo box
	choices to avoid confusing the UI into triggering an update.

	Remove bogus calls to gp_widget_set_changed
	The gp_widget_set_value method sets the changed flag
	on our behalf.

2014-03-26  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix repeated expose events due to auto-drawer
	Every time  entangle_auto_drawer_set_pinned is called it
	triggers an expose event. Check whether it is on the right
	setting before calling it, since we do this in every mouse
	move event. This reduces CPU usage dramatically.

	Add further debug in various camera operations

	Fix inverted test in range widget updates

	Add further debug logs in camera control code

2014-03-14  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

2014-02-16  Cristian Marchi  <cri.penta@gmail.com>

	Setup appdata and desktop files for translation

2014-02-05  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add GExiv2 package to g-ir-scanner

2014-02-04  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix off-by-1 in image histogram tables
	A guchar has 256 possible levels, not 255. The short
	tables resulted in a buffer overflow which in turn
	scrambled the linear/logarithmic setting.

	Don't reset basic camera capabilities on disconnect
	The capture/preview/controls capabilities are populated
	when we detect the camera ports, so must not be reset
	when disconnecting from the camera.

	Add ability to auto-sync camera time on connect
	Add a preference to control whether the camera time
	will be automatically synchronized with the computer
	at time of connection

	Fixes bug #20430

	Add menu option to sync camera clock with PC
	Fixes bug #20430

2014-01-26  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Conditionalize use of gtk_drag_begin_with_coordinates
	The gtk_drag_begin_with_coordinates method is only available
	from GTK 3.10 onwards. Revert to use of gtk_drag_begin for
	earlier GTK versions.

2014-01-14  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Remove version number from about dialog
	Fixes bug #21362

	Add API docs across many frontend classes

2013-12-21  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Fix GTK-DOC comments in application class

	Switch to using gtk_drag_begin_with_coordinates
	Remove use of deprecated gtk_drag_begin in favour of
	gtk_drag_begin_with_coordinates.

	Remove use of deprecated gtk_widget_set_state
	Use gtk_widget_set_state_flages instead of the deprecated
	gtk_widget_set_state.

	Remove use of gexiv2_metadata_get_exif_tag_long
	The gexiv2_metadata_get_exif_tag_long method has moved to a
	private gexiv2 header file, not for application use. Switch
	to use gexiv2_metadata_get_iso_speed instead

	Remove use of deprecated functions for setting color
	Switch to use gtk_widget_override_background_color
	and gtk_widget_override_color functions for setting
	status bar colours.

	Remove use of GtkVBox class in control panel
	Make the control panel class inherit from plain GtkBox
	instead of the deprecated GtkVBox class.

	Remove use of deprecated stock constants
	Use plain strings instead of GTK_STOCK constants which
	are now deprecated

2013-12-15  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Refresh translations from transifex
	Ought to remember todo this *before* a new release next time.

	Update for 0.5.4 release

	Keep the progress/cancel toolbar permanently visible
	The preview API for Canon cameras triggers progress bar
	updates. Since previews are taken many times a second this
	causes the progress bar to show/hide very frequently which
	is unusable. Instead of showing/hiding toolbar controls
	just keep them visible all the time and tweak sensitivity
	when required

	Fixes bug: #21246

	Add some API docs with gir annotations

	Fix leak of image when exiting preview mode

2013-11-27  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Fix bracket whitespace usage
	Import bracket-spacing.pl script from libvirt for
	validating the whitespace around brackets and semicolons

2013-11-24  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove GTK2 compat code
	Entangle is GTK3 only so we can remove the GTK2 compat code
	from the auto-drawer related classes.

2013-11-24  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Move and rename auto-drawer classes
	Move the auto-drawer classes into the main directory. Change the
	naming convention to follow normal GTK practice.

2013-11-24  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Improve ability to control manual focus
	Make the , and . key accelerators to very fine grained
	focus control (64 steps), and allow < and > to do coarse
	grained focus control (512 steps)

	Fixes bug #21101

	Fix missing break in focus key accelerators
	The switch block handling key accelerators was missing
	break statements in the focus code. This focus out was
	always cancelled out by a focus in.

	Reduce intermediate layer opacity to 30%
	To prevent previous images being washed out too quickly
	reduce the opacity of intermediate layers to 30% instead
	of 50%.

	Fixes bug #21288

	Increase opacity of top level image when onion skinning
	Make the top level image stand out more by increasing the
	opacity to 65% instead of 50%.

	Fixes bug #21288

	Remove unused variable in key release handler

2013-11-23  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Introduce menu items for capture/preview
	Add menu items for the capture/preview operations with visible
	key shortcut accelerators. Remove the hand-crafted shortcut
	code.

2013-11-19  Jehan  <jehan@girinstud.io>

	Fix onion skinning in preview mode.
	The dimension of a preview are usually smaller than actual images.
	We take care of this case by scaling buffers to the same size before
	display.

	Fixes bug #21254

2013-11-13  Jehan  <jehan@girinstud.io>

	Do not ever set empty tooltips on capture and preview buttons.
	Fixes bug #21249

	Display the currently selected image when cancelling preview.
	Currently on preview cancel, the last preview image would keep displayed
	until you select a thumbnail. Instead let's redisplay the currently
	selected image directly.

	Also prevent any race condition by not displaying a preview image if the
	preview mode is already cancelled.

	Fixes bug #21253

	Onion skinning in preview mode should show start at the selected image.
	Currently onion skinning adds the images *before* the selected one. But
	in preview mode, it does not make sense. You want to start to layer from
	the selected one, included.

	Fixes bug #21255

	Switch gexiv2 include to use gexiv2/gexiv2.h
	The current pkg-config file for gexiv2 adds a cflag
	of -I$prefix/gexiv2 but this is already broken, since
	the gexiv2/gexiv2.h file includes other files using
	a gexiv2/gexiv2-xxxx.h path. As such current releases
	can only be used if installed in /usr which means the
	default include path works. Future releases of gexiv2
	fix the pkg-config file and will require use of
	gexiv2/gexiv2.h

	Fixes bug #21260

2013-11-01  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Move connect/disconnect item to dedicated menu
	Create a top level "Camera" menu and move the "Connect
	and "Disconnect" items to the new menu.

	Rename all .xml files to .ui

	Make all window classes inherit Gtk classes
	Instead of having all the entangle window classes inherit
	from GObject, make them inherit from the Gtk class that
	corresponds to the type of window in the Gtk Builder file.

	Use a hack whereby the Gtk Builder file primary window
	class name is replaced by the entangle class name before
	being loaded. Introduce a EntangleWindow class to handle
	passing of the GtkBUilder object into the class for init
	purposes.

2013-10-24  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add an appdata XML file for gnome software center
	http://people.freedesktop.org/~hughsient/appdata/

2013-08-30  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Don't use ::PACKAGE:: in desktop file
	The executable name is not required to be the same as the autoconf
	package name, so just hardcode 'entangle' in the desktop file.

	Fix memory leak in generating image thumbnals
	Fix code for generating thumbnails from raw files to not leak
	reference count on pixbuf.

	Ensure thumbnail directory exists
	Before trying to save a thumbnail, ensure the cache directory
	exists.

2013-08-28  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Update for 0.5.3 release

	Add note about release naming scheme

	Hookup to readonly control state changes
	Connect the frontend controls to the notify::readonly signal
	to ensure that readonly state changes are propagated to the
	UI controls

2013-08-27  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Fix thread safety of control update
	The refresh of values for controls often runs in background
	threads. This causes thread safety issues for the GTK controls
	which connect to signals in this controls.

	Fix variable names in EntangleImage class
	s/picker/image/ in several methods

	Fix memory leak in pixbuf loader
	Previous commit fad10008099e015aba3bacc383345a210519bdbd
	fixed a double unref in one scenario, but introduced a
	memory leak in another scenario. The unref must be moved
	inside the 'if (dest == src)' block to fix both problems.

2013-08-24  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Remove Encoding key from desktop file
	The Encoding key is no longer required in desktop files, since
	they are mandated to all use UTF-8

	Fixes bug #20419

	Switch to use gsettings autoconf rule
	Switch to using the GLIB_GSETTINGS autoconf rule to create
	the make rules. This adds a '--disable-schemas-compile'
	arg to configure, which distro packagers should utilize.

	Fixes bug #20223

2013-08-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Re-position tooltip over items
	Ensure the tooltip positions itself over the item that it
	is related to

2013-08-22  Jesper Pedersen  <jesper.pedersen@comcast.net>

	Remove unused adjust_wrap_width method
	The adjust_wrap_width method in the session browser no
	longer does anything useful, since the filename was
	removed. Delete the code.

	Move file name to tooltip
	To allow more room for the image, remove the filename from
	the session browser and use a tooltip instead.

2013-08-17  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Update to 0.5.2 release

	Remove use of 'document_mode' field in raw file generation
	LibRaw >= 0.15 has removed the 'document_mode' field, so we must
	stop using it in Entangle. Fortunately it wasn't doing anything
	important for us.

	Remove trailing whitespace

	Switch to automatically generated AUTHORS file

	Refresh translations from transifex

2013-08-13  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Make metadata query robust to missing metadata
	To avoid displaying garbage when exif data is unset, change to
	explicitly query whether the metadata tag is set before asking
	for the value.

	Ensure camera progress functions run in main thread
	GTK APIs must only be used from the main thread, so the
	camera progress functions must use an idle callback to
	switch to the main thread.

	Skip redraw of items without size allocated
	In the session browser, it is possible for the item draw
	routine to be invoked before a width/height has been set.
	This makes pixman rather unhappy, so skip the drawing
	operation in this case

	Preserve scrollbar offsets when switching images
	When cycling back & forth between images when auto-scale is
	not set, preserve the scrollbar offsets.

	Fix double unref of pixbuf when rotating

	Re-arrange nesting of image display
	To prevent the image statusbar being resized to fit in the image
	scrolled window, re-arrange the nesting of image display. This
	puts the statusbar outside the scrolled window.

	Bug #20429

	Fix args to gtk_grid_attach

2013-08-09  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Use GtkGrid instead of GtkTable if available
	For GTK >= 3.2.0 we can use GtkGrid for layout instead
	of the deprecated GtkTable

	Remove use of deprecated GStaticMutex
	The entangle_camera_is_mounted method can only be called
	from the main thread now, so does not need mutex protection.

	Fix enablement of -Werror

2013-07-09  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add README for translators
	Direct translators towards Transifex

2013-07-08  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Refresh translations from transifex

2013-04-24  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Ensure every event is emitted in main thread
	Ensure that the pixbuf loader emits events in the main
	thread, allowing all calls to gdk threads enter/leave
	to be removed

	Add note about 'h' key for histrogram mode toggle

	Refresh translations from transifex

2013-04-24  Jesper Pedersen  <jesper.pedersen@jboss.org>

	Disable static libraries build

2013-04-09  Simon Booth  <simon.booth@giric.com>

	remove several unused variables. Fix variables initialised twice.

2013-04-02  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove leftover g_printerr statements

2013-04-01  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Refresh translations from transifex

	Apply orientation from EXIF data to images
	If GTK fails to apply any orientation data from the image file,
	then fallback to applying orientation data from the exif
	metadata block

	Set prefs before loading session
	Starting up the session was loaded before the preferences were
	applied. Thus, the first image loaded would be processed using
	the wrong settings.

2013-04-01  Jesper Pedersen  <jesper.pedersen@jboss.org>

	Try to extract preview/thumbnail from raw files
	The exiv2 data stream doesn't always contain good thumbnails for
	raw files. Try to extract a preview/thumbnail from the raw file
	first, then try exiv2, and finally fallback to resizing the main
	image

	Set sane default values for processing raw files
	Set some default parameters for libraw so that it processes files
	using the typical camera defaults. This should give better results,
	particularly with Canon raw files.

	Ensure check for raw files is case insensitive
	When checking the filename extension to identify raw files, convert
	the filename to lowercase first, to ensure the check is case
	insensitive

	Only import known image extension in the session
	Instead of importing all files to a session, only import files
	whose extension is found in a whitelist. This ensures we only
	get image files loaded

	Fix aperture and shutter speed metadata in status bar

	Split histogram into RGB colour channels
	Instead of drawing a single histogram for the overall intensity,
	draw separate graphs for each RGB colour channel. Also draw a
	small 4x4 grid overlay.

2013-02-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Add support for manual focus control during preview

	Add support for autofocus during preview

	End preview by toggling viewfinder action
	If possible, use the view finder control to turn off preview
	mode, otherwise fallback to cpaturing an image

	Remove left over variable from gphoto 2.5 compat fix

	Remove debug line

	Add method to query if viewfinder control is possible

	Fix previous methods for autofocus/manualfocus/viewfinder control

	Filter control sections when loading instead of displaying
	Make EntangleCamera filter the sections, instead of the
	EntangleControlPanel, since some sections are getting formal
	APIs in the camera class

	Add APIs for viewfinder/autofocus/manualfocus control

2013-02-21  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Avoid warnings about deprecated mutex/condition var functions
	In recent glib2 releases several mutex/condition var functions
	are deprecated. Add some macro wrappers to avoid the warnings

	Conditionally use new style gphoto callbacks
	In gphoto >= 2.5 many callbacks changed from 'char *fmt, va_args *'
	to just 'char *msg'. Conditionally use the right signature based
	on version

2012-12-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Update for 0.5.0 release

	Fix man page target name

	Fix docs generation

	Add LibRaw to list of deps in README

	Refresh translations

	Add hack to delete both images when exiting preview
	Since there is no way to exit preview mode, we must take a
	shot and then delete it. If the capture mode is raw+jpeg
	we must take care to delete both images that are captured

	Fix session filename generation to cope with dual-format capture
	When the camera captures raw+jpeg formats at the same time, both
	images must be saved with the same filename prefix

	Rewrite overlay display to be more efficient
	Instead of creating one cairo surface per image and overlaying
	them during the draw event, overlay the images directly into a
	single cairo surface.

2012-12-09  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Tweak debugging in event logging

	Fix updating of range controls
	Fix typo which continually reset range controls back to their
	original value

2012-12-05  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add support for onion skin preferences

	Add ability to render an "onion skin" from a list of images
	Extend the image display widget to take a list of images. Then
	render an "onion skin" overlay with partial opacity. In the
	case of a list with 1 entry, the behaviour is as before.

	Change way image pixbufs are cleared
	Instead of trying to track which image is used in popups,
	just make use of the ref counting in the image loader. Add
	"unload" signals to the image loader to enable detection
	of when last use is released.

	Sort images by name instead of modified date

	Ensure camera is disconnected on window close/app exit
	When hiding a camera manager window, disassociate the
	camera, so it gets closed cleanly, otherwise some Canon
	cameras will hang.

2012-11-28  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Reindent to normalize whitespace

2012-11-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix deadlock unmounting camera at startup
	The startup code should be using gdk_threads_{enter,leave}
	since we make use of threads. When umounting a camera we
	entered a recursive main loop. This caused GDK to try to
	unlock a mutex that was never locked, corrupting mutex
	state. The result was a later hang next time GDK tried to
	lock the mutex.

	We can't acquire the mutex in the activate callback, since
	that can be called from scenarios where the lock is already
	held. Thus we move our code into the startup method instead
	and just make activate do a window show.

2012-11-21  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Allow camera to be NULL
	Re-add 9a977e23d9f399b8ae2afab98cddec0022e5a276 accidentally
	reverted

	Remove bogus assertion check

	Control histogram height to match default icon panel height

	Use 'src' from finish callback, since priv->camera might be NULL
	When saving camera controls using an async callback, make sure the
	callback uses the passed in 'src' parameter instead of relying on
	priv->camera which may now be NULL

	Allow camera to be NULL in control panel

	Avoid GTK assertion if min=max
	The GTK range widgets can't cope with the (entirely reasonable)
	scenario where the min value == max value. Hack a workaround for
	this by increasing the max value by 1.0 and setting the control
	readonly instead

2012-09-02  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix unref of cairo surface object in image display

	on GTK 2.x

	Fix build on GTK < 3.4
	The GDK_SCROLL_SMOOTH constant is only available in GTK >= 3.4
	Bug #19918

	Rename 'index' variable to 'idx' to avoid symbol clash
	There is a global function called 'index' in some headers, so
	local variables should not use the same name. Bug #19918

	Change gfloat to gdouble in image display
	There is some inconsistent use of gfloat vs gdouble in files.
	Switch to using gdouble in the image display to address this.
	Bug #20122

	Fix some data types to use the glib variants

	Fix aspect ratio string->double conversion to be locale-indepedent
	The strtod() function has variable meaning for '.' according to
	the locale. This caused the aspect ratio conversions to go wrong.
	Switch to using g_ascii_strtod() instead. Bug #19929

	The Peas library requires that its GObject Introspection metadata
	is loaded prior to searching for plugins

2012-08-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Add support for displaying an image histogram in the control panel
	The control panel is changed to be always visible even when no
	camera is connected. This is to allow it to display the histogram
	for the selected image

2012-08-12  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Don't clear image pixbuf while a popup is still open

	Ensure popup-close signal is always invoked in all code paths

	Fix drag popup when image is already selected
	If the image was already selected in the session browser, then
	a drag would not be initialized.

	Use key press handler in session browser
	If the key release handler is used in session browser for
	procesing keys, then some parent handler might take action
	based on the key press event before we get a chance to

	Fix widget leak when closing image popup
	When the EntangleImagePopup class was unref'd the GtkWindow
	still remained in existance. Fix this by destroying the window
	in the popup finalize method

	Fix memory leak when displaying image popup
	If the image already has an active popup, attempting to display
	it again will leak a reference count

	Keep toolbar dir in sync with current session dir

	Close all image popups when changing session

	Add popup menu in session browser
	Add a popup menu in the session browser which can be used for
	deleteing unwanted images, and opening images in external
	applications

	Merge 'new session' and 'open session' into 'select session'
	Since the "Open Folder" widget is capable of creating folders,

2012-07-02  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Add ability to blank screen while capturing images
	Add a new preference to control screen blanking. If enabled,
	the screen will be blanked via DPMS Standby mode while the
	image is captured, and unblanked afterwards. Any mouse or
	keyboard movement will also unblank the screen early.

	Add APIs for screen blanking via X11 DPMS extension

	Fix two horrible memory leaks of EntangleImage
	The preview code would leak every single frame captured during

	Fix update of mask opacity property

	Fix type of aspect ratio property
	The aspect ratio property was mistakenly declared as an int
	instead of a string.

	Don't fill thumbnail edges with black
	Set thumbnail edges to be transparent to allow widget
	background colour to show

	Ensure UI updates when aspect ratio preferences are changed

	Allow aspect ratio mask to be toggled on/off more easily
	Instead of overloading the 'aspect-ratio' preference to '' to
	signify disabled mask, use an explicit 'mask-enabled' pref.
	Also allow the key 'm' to toggle it on/off

	Add some key shortcuts for common operations
	Allow use of keys

	 - 's' - trigger the shutter
	 - 'p' - toggle 'live view' preview
	 - 'esc' - cancel the current operation

	Refactor image loading code to allow easier access to pixbuf
	Directly associate the loaded GdkPixbuf with the EntangleImage
	object. This allows multiple UI widget to directly access the
	pixbuf without all of them needing to know about the
	EntangleImageLoader class. The EntangleCameraManager class
	is now in charge of loading/unloading the pixbufs

2011-02-04  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Some camera drivers claim to support controls, but then don't
	return any. This updates the UI code to cope with this situation
	instead of crashing

	* frontend/entangle-camera-manager.c: Hide controls panel
	  and disable settings menu/toolbutton if no controls are

2010-09-14  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove EntangleParams class that required GPhoto gir hack
	The GPhoto-2.0.gir hack is required because EntangleParams
	exposes some libgphoto2 typedefs in a public struct. By
	removing this class and moving the objects into the private
	impl, the GIR hack is no longer required

	Port over to use libpeas for plugins
	Remove all custom plugin handling code. Replace with (optional)
	use of libpeas.

2010-07-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <dan@berrange.com>

	Adapt to cope with cameras which don't support events
	The non-PTP drivers do not support event notifications. Adapt the
	event flush/wait code to avoid failing in these scenarios, since
	capture still works fine

2010-07-19  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Use GError APis for reporting capture failure
	Wire up GError for capture, preview, download, delete and event
	wait operations. Display error to user if task fails. Log all

	Fix infinite loop waiting for events
	Fix an unknown event occurs the loop could potentially go on
	forever. Track wallclock time to ensure an absolute upper
	bound on waiting for events

	Set worker to NULL when exiting
	When the worker thread exits it is important to set priv->worker
	to NULL to ensure other methods see it is not running

2010-06-13  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Make a sane implementation of the preview function
	Replace the 'cancelled' method on the progress interface, with

2010-04-07  Daniel Berrange  <berrange@t500wlan.home.berrange.com>

	Fix hang when changing configuration values
	The camera schedular thread runs continuously in the background
	waiting for events. It is thus neccessary to pause this background
	thread whenever updating a control value in the foreground thread.

2010-04-05  Daniel Berrange  <berrange@localhost.localdomain>

	Add filename labels in session browser & image info popup

	Fix thumbnail orientation

	Fix logic bug that broke thumbnail resizing

	Set widget readonly state on camera controls
	GPhoto now has an API for discovering whether a camera control
	is readonly. This can be used to set the GTK widget to be non
	sensitive

2010-04-04  Daniel Berrange  <berrange@localhost.localdomain>

	Rewrite filename generation code to preserve original extension
	Rewrite the session filename generation code to preserve the
	original filename extension as provided by the camera/gphoto.
	ie stop giving raw files a .jpeg extension !

	Add & ignore GP_EVENT_CAPTURE_COMPLETE to prevent bogus failures

2010-04-02  Daniel Berrange  <berrange@localhost.localdomain>

	Allow presentation mode to set monitor to diplay on
	The view menu gets popupulated with a list of named monitors in
	the screen. The presentation mode can be switched between the
	different monitors. Fullscreen also now hides the menubar

2010-03-31  Daniel Berrange  <berrange@localhost.localdomain>

	Add a real presentation mode
	Add a real presentation mode where the only thing visible is the image
	display window, in fullscreen.

	Use proper glib API for finding user pictures directory

	Port to gudev library
	Use the gudev library for monitoring devices in preference to
	HAL, where available

	Fix 100% cpu loop on camera disconnect & potential crash
	When the camera disconnects care must be taken that all camera
	functions return false and not try to access a NULL gphoto camera
	object. The background event loop must also check for a disconnected
	camera and not spin 100% cpu waiting for events that will never
	arrive

	Fix thread safety in task-end callback & disconnect camera
	The task-end callback invokes GTK functions and is emitted from
	a background thread, thus it must be protected by the GDK threads
	lock.

	When the camera is removed from the camera manager, the camera
	must be switched to disconnected state

2010-03-30  Daniel Berrange  <berrange@localhost.localdomain>

	Rename Capa -> Entangle
	Renaming the project from "Capa" to "Entangle". This renames all
	files with 'capa' in the name, and changes all source code symbols

	Add setters/getters for camera info object

	Add setters/getters to pixbuf loader object

	Add getter & setter for camera progress property

	Standard naming convention for "getters" on camera class

	Cache camera docs to avoid possible thread race condition
	The gphoto library must only be used from one thread at once for
	absolute safety, so camera driver/manual/summary strings should
	be cached just in case

	Fix session changing code
	The session changing code was setting a property which no longer
	exists on the camera class

2010-03-06  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix printf format specifier

	Basic framework for new config management system
	* backend/capa-config-entry.h, backend/capa-config-entry.c: Object
	  for a single configuration value
	* backend/capa-config-set.h, backend/capa-config-set.c: Object for
	  a group of configuration values
	* backend/capa-config-store.c, backend/capa-config-store.c: Backing
	  store for all configuration values

2010-02-15  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Switch capture/preview/monitor over to scheduler task & rip out old code
	The old threads code from the camera class is ripped out. The camera
	manager frontend now triggers all operations via the new camera
	scheduler object.

	Add progress debug logging on control building process

	Fix typo in object class name

	Camera execution script and task system
	To make the capture process more flexible, the hardcoded preview,
	monitor & capture threads need to be moved out of the camera
	class. This commit introduces a general purpose camera scheduler
	that runs in a background thread monitoring for events. It then
	accepts queuing of tasks to execute. Tasks are provided for the
	basic operations.

2010-02-14  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Refactor camera capture routines to prepare for scripts
	Introduce an explicit object for representing a file on the camera.
	Separate out methods for capturing, downloading & deleting files
	from the camera. Rewrite existing background threads to use the
	new APIs.

2010-01-13  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Don't abort monitoring when getting an unexpected event

2010-01-12  berrange  <berrange@dhcp-0-224.camlab.fab.redhat.com>

	Ignore Makefile.am file

2010-01-12  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Merge CapaPluginBase into CapaPlugin inteface
	The CapaPlugin interface was not serving any useful purpose. This
	change merges the CapaPluginBase abstract class into CapaPlugin
	removing the interface

2010-01-11  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix gint64 printf format specifier for x86_64
	Can't assume that gint64 format specific is %llu on x86_64. GLib
	provides a portable macro G_GUINT64_FORMAT so use that instead.

2010-01-10  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Rename all source files added 'capa-' prefix
	Avoid potential include file namespace problems by adding a 'capa-'
	prefix to all source files

	Integrate with gtk-doc for API reference generation

	Remove auto-generated INSTALL file

	Move debug variables out of main.c into separate debug.c
	In order for gtk-doc to link to the library for scanning, it is
	neccessary to move the debug flags into a separate file.

	Rename some methods in CapaApp and annotate for introspection data
	The introspection transfer mode was incorrect for methods in
	CapaApp, so they had to be annotated. The getters are also renamed
	to add 'get_' prefix.

2010-01-09  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Turn off colour profile debugging

2010-01-03  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Pass the 'CapaPlugin' instance to the plugin activate methods
	The plugin may need to know its base directory in order to load
	other assets such as images. To allow for this, it is neccessary
	to pass the CapaPlugin instance into the plugin's activate/deactive
	methods

	Switch UI out of operation mode when camera is removed
	The current camera may be removed from the manager window while an
	operation is in progress (particularly when monitoring for new images
	in the background). In this case it is neccessary to toggle the
	'inOperation' flag to update the UI

	Remove obsolete, unused 'camera-progress' window definition
	The camera progress window was removed in a previous commit, the
	progress display being incorporated into the main manager window.
	The glade definition of the 'camera-progress' window is thus
	obsolete & unused.

	Fix crash in background thread when progress monitor is removed
	When disconnecting the UI from a camera, there may still be a
	background job active using the progress monitor. Therefore it
	is neccessary to include checks for NULL on the progress object

	Disconnect camera from display when camera is removed
	When a camera is removed, and it matches the camera currently opened
	in the display, it must be removed, disabling the UI.

	Make 'CapaAppDisplay' inherit from 'CapaApp'
	The plugins get given a handle to a 'CapaApp' instance. By making
	the CapaAppDisplay type inherit from 'CapaApp', they can get access
	to the UI objects

	Clarify warning text when camera cannot be connected to

	Fix missing word in camera picker warning message
	* src/capa.glade: Add missing 'when' in warning message

2009-12-29  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Update the website content to match current reality

	Re-order buttons on toolbar to move important ones to the left

	Merge capture/preview/monitor tool buttons into one
	Declutter the toolbar slightly by merging the separate buttons for
	capture/preview/montior into one button with a drop down menu. This
	will also allow scripts to populate the menu with other options
	like timed/sequenced shooting

	Pull the progress display into the toolbar instead of popup window

2009-12-05  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Misc enhancements to colour management
	* Auto-rebuild colour transform when preferences change
	* Fix crash when a profile is NULL
	* Honour requested rendering intent

	Auto apply any orientation info when displaying images/thumbnails

2009-12-04  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix build ordering dependancy for generated enums

	Remove obsolete comment and class variable

	Introduce an async thumbnail loader
	Subclass pixbuf loader to provide a thumbnail loader. Attempts to
	following the thumbnail spec for caching thumbnails

	http://jens.triq.net/thumbnail-spec/index.html

	Pull most of image loader out into a abstract pixbuf loader base
	Introduce a CapaPixbufLoader base class which does most of the
